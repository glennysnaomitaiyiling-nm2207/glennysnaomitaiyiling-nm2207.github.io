    <h4>what is your project about?</h4>
    <p>The project is about the issue of income inequality in Singapore â€“ why it happens, why it is important, how it affects citizens, why financial assistance implementations are effective or ineffective, what factors systemically disadvantage some people and restrict their socioeconomic mobility. I aim to explore wealth distribution in Singapore, (eg. average/median income, disparities in income across demographics like race, gender, level of education, etc) as well as changes in income, inflation and cost of living over time. </p>
    <h4>What is the data you plan to use?</h4>
    <p>
    Proportion of population in each income group
    <br>
    Income levels by race, gender, education level
    <br>
    Quality of life by income level
    <br>
    Expenditure group by income group  to show proportion of income that is spent by each income group:

    <br>
    Changes in inflation, cost of living and income over time
    <br>
    Data about financial assistance schemes in singapore?
    </p>
    <h4>What is the question you plan to answer?</h4>
    <p>How severe is the income inequality situation in Singapore?</p>
    <h4>Why is this an important question?</h4>
    <p>Singapore is a country that prides itself on great economic growth and good quality of life. While these things may be true, I believe there is still a significant portion of the population that falls through the cracks despite government measures, and that many peopple aren't aware of precisely because Singapore is a wealthy nation overall. I've also often heard the notion that poor people are poor simply because they haven't worked hard enough, and would like to question this idea by finding out other factors that could contribute to it.</p>
