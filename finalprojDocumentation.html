      <h4>3. What is the question you plan to answer?</h4>
      <p>How severe is the income inequality situation in Singapore?</p>
      <h4>4. Why is this an important question?</h4>
      <p>While income inequality in Singapore may not be considered one of the highest in the world, Singapore is ranked one of the most unequal countries among wealthy ones, second only to Hong Kong (according to Teo You Yenn, 2018) In 2016, the Gini coefficient in Singapore was 0.458, and the per capita income for the wealthiest 10% of households is $12773, 23 times more than the lowest 10% households ($543). There is also a the lack of a clear poverty line in Singapore, which makes it harder to determine who and how much of the country can be considered poor and requires additional assistance. 
        <br><br>
        This, together with Singapore’s overall good economic performance, results in a situation where the ‘poor’ in Singapore are obscured and, according to Nathan Peng (2019), there is a divergence between largely stable macro-trends and “felt” inequality experienced by citizens. While the state promotes ideas of meritocracy and equal opportunities, it is precisely these narratives that allow the issue of poverty to be seen as one resulting from individual flaws rather than structural ones (hence, the idea that poor people are simply lazy) (Smith, et al. 2015).
        <br><br>
        However, in reality there are factors which systematically disadvantage some parts of the population over others, such as intersections of poverty with race and gender. 
        <br><br>
        According to the Census of Population 2010: Statistical Release 2 – Households and Housing, the median income of Singaporean Malays, SGD 3,844 is well below the national average of SGD 5,000 SGD, and below that of Chinese and Indian Singaporeans, whose median incomes were SGD 7,432 and SGD 5,370 respectively. Other data also show how educational performance and sense of belonging are continuously tied to socio-economic position (Peng, 2019)
      </p>
      <h4>5. Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question?</h4>
      <p>using every column of the "number of resident households" row, i can create a chart to show the distribution of households in each income group to get a better idea of the wealth distribution in Singapore, and what proportion of households falls below the estimated $2906/month living wage (LKY school of Public Policy).
        <br><br>
        i will first try to find the average income for each income group. using this and the average monthly expenditure for each income group, i will calculate the average proportion of income spent by each group. this will show that although lower income households spend much less than high income groups, there is a limit to how much they can reduce spending (and it still takes up a large part of their income -> harder for them to save money)
      </p>
      <h4>challenges</h4>
      <p>
        i have yet to find a single, comprehensive dataset that contains multiple types of data that i plan to use, and i have been having trouble finding some of the information that i need. however, i found a lot of research papers on different aspects of the topic that reference data from multiple sources, although it's taking a long time to read through these papers and look through all the references.

    <h4>what is your project about?</h4>
    <p>The project is about the issue of income inequality in Singapore – why it happens, why it is important, how it affects citizens, why financial assistance implementations are effective or ineffective, what factors systemically disadvantage some people and restrict their socioeconomic mobility. I aim to explore wealth distribution in Singapore, (eg. average/median income, disparities in income across demographics like race, gender, level of education, etc) as well as changes in income, inflation and cost of living over time. </p>
    <h4>What is the data you plan to use?</h4>
    <p>
    Proportion of population in each income group
    <br>
    Income levels by race, gender, education level
    <br>
    Quality of life by income level

    <h4>What is the question you plan to answer?</h4>
    <p>How severe is the income inequality situation in Singapore?</p>
    <h4>Why is this an important question?</h4>
    <p>Singapore is a country that prides itself on great economic growth and good quality of life. While these things may be true, I believe there is still a significant portion of the population that falls through the cracks despite government measures, and that many peopple aren't aware of precisely because Singapore is a wealthy nation overall. I've also often heard the notion that poor people are poor simply because they haven't worked hard enough, and would like to question this idea by finding out other factors that could contribute to it.</p>
